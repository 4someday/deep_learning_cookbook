# Deep Learning Cookbook Notebooks

This repository contains 41 python notebooks demonstrating most of the key
machine learning techniques in Keras. The notebooks accompany the book
[Deep Learning Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Cookbook-Practical-Recipes) but work well on their own. A GPU is not required to run them,
but on a mere CPU things will take quite a while.

## Getting started

To get started, setup a virtual env, install the requirements and start the notebook server:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/DOsinga/deep_learning_cookbook.git
cd deep_learning_cookbook
python3 -m venv venv3
source venv3/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
